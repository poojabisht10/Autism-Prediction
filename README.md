# Autism Prediction Model

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict autism using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The models assessed include the Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used for this project is available in the same repository. It contains more instances of negative outcomes than positive ones, prompting the use of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the data through over-sampling.

## Models and Evaluation
The models were trained and tested using scikit-learn's train-test split, with performance assessed via cross-validation. The models evaluated are:

- *Decision Tree Classifier*
- *Random Forest Classifier*
- *Logistic Regression*

## Results Summary
The highest accuracy achieved was *93%, obtained using the **Random Forest Classifier*.
